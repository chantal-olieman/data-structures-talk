# Data structures in Python

This repo contains two tech talks I gave at MOCS about data structures in Python. 

The first talk contains:
- Big O notations
- Nodes
- Stacks and Queues

The [second talk](/talk/data-structures-2.md) contains:
- Nodes
- Trees
- Tree traversal
- Graphs
- Graph representation
- Dijkstra
- Heaps

The [source folder](/src) contains an exercise on BSF and tests to verify the answers. 
The correct answers for this exercise can be found on [the answers branch](https://github.com/chantal-olieman/data-structures-talk/tree/2-answers).
